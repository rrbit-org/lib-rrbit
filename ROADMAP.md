* Basic operations
    * [x] update(e.g. set) operation
        * [ ] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~nth(e.g. get) operation~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~append(e.g.push) operation~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~updateAll(e.g. concat) operation~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    * [x] prepend(e.g. unshift) operation
        * [ ] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~drop operation~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~take operation~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~iterator~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    * [x] ~~reverse iterator~~
        * [x] passes all tests
    
* Performance
    * [x] implement movable 'focus' from 2015 paper
    * [x] remove closures
    * [x] switch statements instead of loops
    * [x] inline happy paths
        * [x] append: 100%
        * [ ] prepend: 0%
        * [ ] appendAll: 0%
        * [ ] take: 0%
        * [ ] drop: 0%
        * [ ] update: 0%
    * [ ] implement mutable focus(like clojure does)
    * [x] inlined 'reduce' iteration
    * [x] inlined short-circuitable(e.g. find) iteration
